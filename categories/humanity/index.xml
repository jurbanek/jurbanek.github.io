      <description>Language and culture are intimately related. Human communication is arguably one of the most complex negotiations in the known Universe (citation needed).
A principal factor in assessing an organization&#39;s engineering culture is reviewing how engineering resources communicate, both verbally and in writing.
Regardless of engineering field, any technical discipline that interfaces with humanity (very close to my personal definition of engineering) finds itself communicating ideas, operations, limitations, concerns, and recommendations with other engineers, scientists, technicians, and customers.</description>
